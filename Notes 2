JAVASCRIPT

VARIABLES
---------
---------

It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script.

let carName = "Volvo";

let person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;

let person = "John Doe",
carName = "Volvo",
price = 200;

let carName; - means variable is declared but undefined

$ and _ are seen as a letters,  and therefore valid as a variable name


OPERATORS

In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.
alert(15%9);    - means remainder
