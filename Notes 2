JAVASCRIPT

VARIABLES
---------
---------

It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script.

let carName = "Volvo";

let person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;

let person = "John Doe",
carName = "Volvo",
price = 200;

let carName; - means variable is declared but undefined

$ and _ are seen as a letters,  and therefore valid as a variable name


OPERATORS
---------
---------

In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.

Arithmetic

Operator	Description
+	        Addition
-	        Subtraction
*	        Multiplication
**	      Exponentiation - the operation of raising one quantity to the power of another. (ES2016)
/	        Division
%	        Modulus (Division Remainder) - alert(15%9);    - means remainder (6)
++	      Increment
--	      Decrement

Assignment

Operator	Example	   Same As
=	        x = y      x = y
+=	      x += y	   x = x + y
-=	      x -= y	   x = x - y
*=	      x *= y	   x = x * y
/=	      x /= y	   x = x / y
%=	      x %= y	   x = x % y
**=	      x **= y	   x = x ** y

Shift Assignment Operators

Operator	Example	      Same As
<<=	      x <<= y	      x = x << y
>>=	      x >>= y	      x = x >> y
>>>=	    x >>>= y	    x = x >>> y

Bitwise Assignment Operators

Operator	Example	      Same As
&=	      x &= y	      x = x & y
^=	      x ^= y	      x = x ^ y
|=	      x |= y	      x = x | y

Logical Assignment Operators

Operator	Example	      Same As
&&=     	x &&= y	      x = x && (x = y)
||=	      x ||= y	      x = x || (x = y)
??=	      x ??= y	      x = x ?? (x = y)
